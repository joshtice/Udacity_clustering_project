    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

    "### Step 0: Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four files associated with this project (not including this one):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.\n",
    "- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, load in the demographics data for the general population into a pandas DataFrame, and do the same for the feature attributes summary. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project: they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so you'll need an additional argument in your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the dataset is loaded, it's recommended that you take a little bit of time just browsing the general structure of the dataset and feature summary file. You'll be getting deep into the innards of the cleaning in the first major step of the project, so gaining some general familiarity can help you get your bearings."

First of all, you should assess the demographics data in terms of missing data. Pay attention to the following points as you perform your analysis, and take notes on what you observe. Make sure that you fill in the **Discussion** cell with your findings and decisions at the end of each step that has one!\n",

While the file encodes this as a list (e.g. `[-1,0]`), this will get read in as a string object. You'll need to do a little bit of parsing to make use of it to identify and clean the data. Convert data that matches a 'missing' or 'unknown' value code into a numpy NaN value. You might want to see how much data takes on a 'missing' or 'unknown' code, and how much data is naturally missing, as a point of interest.\n",

    "#### Discussion 1.1.2: Assess Missing Data in Each Column\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 85 features in the dataset, six of the features had 200,000 missing values or more, and they were removed from the dataset as outliers. The features are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AGER_TYP (Best-ager typology)\n",
    "* GEBURTSJAHR (Year of birth)\n",
    "* TITEL_KZ (Academic title flag)\n",
    "* ALTER_HH (Birthdate of head of household)\n",
    "* KK_KUNDENTYP (Consumer pattern over past 12 months)\n",
    "* KBA05_BAUMAX (Most common building type within the microcell)\n",
    "\n",
    "For two of these features, I was not surprised to see a high proportion of missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would expect a large number of outliers for \"Best-ager typology\", since this feature captures information only for elderly citizens, and only about 20% of the German population is over 65 years of age ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany#Demographic_statistics)). Similarly, I would also expect only a small fraction of the population to have relevant data for the \"Academic title flag\". PhD's and Dr's do not constitute a large percentage of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was initially surprised, however, to see the remaining four features missing many data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rough estimates of individuals' age were well-captured by features such as \"Estimated age based on given name analysis\", but \"Year of birth\" and \"Birthdate of head of household\" were relatively sparse. Thinking about my own experience of buying products online, I imagine that my exact age would be readily available. Probably 20% of my purchases ask me to enter my date of birth. Similarly, I assume that my \"Consumer pattern over past 12 months\" would also be easily attainable. My primary hypothesis, then, as to why these data are limited in the German dataset would be that European laws are more restrictive around the sharing of personal data from online sources. A secondary hypothesis could be that these data are available, but they are controlled by large technology companies such as Google, and this particular firm did not procure the data for this study. The last feature with many missing values - \"Most common building type within the microcell\" - may have been obtained from a focused study rather than a nation-wide census.\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing these outlier features from the dataset, several clusters were identified with the same number of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I would hypothesize that clusters of features with the same number of missing values likely originated from the same study. I thought several of these clusters revealed interesting information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Person-level features:** One cluster of features was missing only 4854 values - most of them related to Person-level data. This cluster was notable due to the fact that so few values were missing. I would expect these data to be especially valuable for the analysis as they reveal nearly complete information about \"Customer-Journey-Typology\", \"Vacation habits\", \"Social status\", \"Likelihood to return products\", and \"Online affinity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regional features:**  Several clusters emerged from features containing regional information. As an example, the PLZ8 region had several features with 116515 missing values. This means, however, that the remaining ~87% of the dataset DID contain data with PLZ8 features. The dataset also has specific information for the RR4 microcell, RR3 microcell, and RR1 region that are missing less than ~22% of values. I conclude that the dataset is biased toward consumers in these regions, which should be carefully noted when making conclusions based on the data."

    "#### Step 1.1.3: Assess Missing Data in Each Row\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you'll perform a similar assessment for the rows of the dataset. How much data is missing in each row? As with the columns, you should see some groups of points that have a very different numbers of missing values. Divide the data into two subsets: one for data points that are above some threshold for missing values, and a second subset for points below that threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to know what to do with the outlier rows, we should see if the distribution of data values on columns that are not missing data (or are missing very little data) are similar or different between the two groups. Select at least five of these columns and compare the distribution of values.\n",
    "- You can use seaborn's [`countplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html) function to create a bar chart of code frequencies and matplotlib's [`subplot()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html) function to put bar charts for the two subplots side by side.\n",
    "- To reduce repeated code, you might want to write a function that can perform this comparison, taking as one of its arguments a column to be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what you observe in your comparison, this will have implications on how you approach your conclusions later in the analysis. If the distributions of non-missing features look similar between the data with many missing values and the data with few or no missing values, then we could argue that simply dropping those points from the analysis won't present a major issue. On the other hand, if the data with many missing values looks very different from the data with few or no missing values, then we should make a note on those data as special. We'll revisit these data later on. **Either way, you should continue your analysis for now using just the subset of the data with few or no missing values.**"

    "### Step 1.2: Select and Re-Encode Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for missing data isn't the only way in which you can prepare a dataset for analysis. Since the unsupervised learning techniques to be used will only work on data that is encoded numerically, you need to make a few encoding changes or additional assumptions to be able to make progress. In addition, while almost all of the values in the dataset are encoded using numbers, not all of them represent numeric values. Check the third column of the feature summary (`feat_info`) for a summary of types of measurement.\n",
    "- For numeric and interval data, these features can be kept without changes.\n",
    "- Most of the variables in the dataset are ordinal in nature. While ordinal values may technically be non-linear in spacing, make the simplifying assumption that the ordinal variables can be treated as being interval in nature (that is, kept without any changes).\n",
    "- Special handling may be necessary for the remaining two variable types: categorical, and 'mixed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two parts of this sub-step, you will perform an investigation of the categorical and mixed-type features and make a decision on each of them, whether you will keep, drop, or re-encode each. Then, in the last part, you will create a new data frame with only the selected and engineered columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling is often the trickiest part of the data analysis process, and there's a lot of it to be done here. But stick with it: once you're done with this step, you'll be ready to get to the machine learning parts of the project!"

    "- For binary (two-level) categoricals that take numeric values, you can keep them without needing to do anything.\n",

    "Eighteen categorical variables were identified. The binary categorical variables with numeric representations were left as is. 'OST_WEST_KZ', a binary text variable, was converted to a binary numeric type. Categorical variables with non-numeric encoding or with more than two categories were one-hot encoded with pandas' get_dummies method, with three exceptions. 'LP_FAMILIE_FEIN' and 'LP_STATUS_FEIN' were fine-scale representations of 'LP_FAMILIE_GROB' and 'LP_STATUS_GROB', respectively. Since they were mostly redundant and would have introduced over 20 additional features collectively if they were one-hot encoded, I dropped them from the analysis. 'CAMEO_DEU_2015' was also dropped from the analysis because I judged the information was too nuanced to be useful to the analysis. One-hot encoding 'CAMEO_DEU_2015' would have also led to 45 additional features, which could have later diluted the variability of the components resulting from principal component analysis."

    "\n",
    "Before we apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the data, we need to perform feature scaling so that the principal component vectors are not influenced by the natural differences in scale for features. Starting from this part of the project, you'll want to keep an eye on the [API reference page for sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) to help you navigate to all of the classes and functions that you'll need. In this substep, you'll need to check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sklearn requires that data not have missing values in order for its estimators to work properly. So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",
    "- For the actual scaling function, a [StandardScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) instance is suggested, scaling each feature to mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "- For these classes, you can make use of the `.fit_transform()` method to both fit a procedure to the data as well as apply the transformation to the data at the same time. Don't forget to keep the fit sklearn objects handy, since you'll be applying them to the customer demographics data towards the end of the project."

    "### Discussion 2.1: Apply Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though columns and rows with a high proportion of NaNs were removed in previous steps, 22% of the remaining rows still had one missing value or more. Simply dropping 22% of the data seemed to be capable of significantly altering the outcome of the analysis. Consequently, the missing values were replaced with the median value of the corresponding feature. The median was chosen because many of the columns were one-hot encoded categorical data, *i.e.*, zeros and ones. Choosing the mean could have resulted in fractional data that was not relevant. For continuous data, the median reduced the influence of outliers. Finally, the data was scaled to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one."

    "\n",
    "- Use sklearn's [PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) class to apply principal component analysis on the data, thus finding the vectors of maximal variance in the data. To start, you should not set any parameters (so all components are computed) or set a number of components that is at least half the number of features (so there's enough features to see the general trend in variability).\n",
    "- Check out the ratio of variance explained by each principal component as well as the cumulative variance explained. Try plotting the cumulative or sequential values using matplotlib's [`plot()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html) function. Based on what you find, select a value for the number of transformed features you'll retain for the clustering part of the project.\n",
    "- Once you've made a choice for the number of components to keep, make sure you re-fit a PCA instance to perform the decided-on transformation."

    "Twenty principal components were chosen for the remaining analysis. The initial principle component analysis on the dataset showed that the the first twenty or so components could explain at least ~1% of the variance each. After the first twenty components, the amount of variance explained per component plateaued, and then eventually decreased again after 60 components. The cumulative graph of variance explained by component showed that the first twenty components could explain ~40% of the variance in the data."

    "### Step 2.3: Interpret Principal Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our transformed principal components, it's a nice idea to check out the weight of each variable on the first few components to see if they can be interpreted in some fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, each principal component is a unit vector that points in the direction of highest variance (after accounting for the variance captured by earlier principal components). The further a weight is from zero, the more the principal component is in the direction of the corresponding feature. If two features have large weights of the same sign (both positive or both negative), then increases in one tend expect to be associated with increases in the other. To contrast, features with different signs can be expected to show a negative correlation: increases in one variable should result in a decrease in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To investigate the features, you should map each weight to their corresponding feature name, then sort the features according to weight. The most interesting features for each principal component, then, will be those at the beginning and end of the sorted list. Use the data dictionary document to help you understand these most prominent features, their relationships, and what a positive or negative value on the principal component might indicate.\n",
    "- You should investigate and interpret feature associations from the first three principal components in this substep. To help facilitate this, you should write a function that you can call at any time to print the sorted list of feature weights, for the *i*-th principal component. This might come in handy in the next step of the project, when you interpret the tendencies of the discovered clusters."

In this substep, you will apply k-means clustering to the dataset and use the average within-cluster distances from each point to their assigned cluster's centroid to decide on a number of clusters to keep.\n",

    "- Then, compute the average difference from each point to its assigned cluster's center. **Hint**: The KMeans object's `.score()` method might be useful here, but note that in sklearn, scores tend to be defined so that larger is better. Try applying it to a small, toy dataset, or use an internet search to help your understanding.\n",
    "- Perform the above two steps for a number of different cluster counts. You can then see how the average distance decreases with an increasing number of clusters. However, each additional cluster provides a smaller net benefit. Use this fact to select a final number of clusters in which to group the data. **Warning**: because of the large size of the dataset, it can take a long time for the algorithm to resolve. The more clusters to fit, the longer the algorithm will take. You should test for cluster counts through at least 10 clusters to get the full picture, but you shouldn't need to test for a number of clusters above about 30.\n",
    "- Once you've selected a final number of clusters to use, re-fit a KMeans instance to perform the clustering operation. Make sure that you also obtain the cluster assignments for the general demographics data, since you'll be using them in the final Step 3.3."

    "The data were clustered using a K-Means algorithm with the number of clusters ranging from two to twenty. The training data were sampled with a mini-batch approach to speed the analysis. After examining the resulting Scree plot, no clear \"elbow\" was evident when increasing the number of clusters. Perhaps the distance metric dropped more dramatically for the first 4-8 features, but only marginally so. I chose to complete the remainder of the analysis with 8 clusters, since this would give the algorithm the opportunity to divide the population into binary combinations of the first three principal components (2^3 = 8), if possible."

That is, you should not be using a `.fit()` or `.fit_transform()` method to re-fit the old objects, nor should you be creating new sklearn objects!

    "At this point, you have clustered data based on demographics of the general population of Germany, and seen how the customer data for a mail-order sales company maps onto those demographic clusters. In this final substep, you will compare the two cluster distributions to see where the strongest customer base for the company is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the proportion of persons in each cluster for the general population, and the proportions for the customers. If we think the company's customer base to be universal, then the cluster assignment proportions should be fairly similar between the two. If there are only particular segments of the population that are interested in the company's products, then we should see a mismatch from one to the other. If there is a higher proportion of persons in a cluster for the customer data compared to the general population (e.g. 5% of persons are assigned to a cluster for the general population, but 15% of the customer data is closest to that cluster's centroid) then that suggests the people in that cluster to be a target audience for the company. On the other hand, the proportion of the data in a cluster being larger in the general population than the customer data (e.g. only 2% of customers closest to a population centroid that captures 6% of the data) suggests that group of persons to be outside of the target demographics.\n",

    "- Compute the proportion of data points in each cluster for the general population and the customer data. Visualizations will be useful here: both for the individual dataset proportions, but also to visualize the ratios in cluster representation between groups. Seaborn's [`countplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html) or [`barplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) function could be handy.\n",
    "  - Recall the analysis you performed in step 1.1.3 of the project, where you separated out certain data points from the dataset if they had more than a specified threshold of missing values. If you found that this group was qualitatively different from the main bulk of the data, you should treat this as an additional data cluster in this analysis. Make sure that you account for the number of data points in this subset, for both the general population and customer datasets, when making your computations!\n",
    "- Which cluster or clusters are overrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population? Select at least one such cluster and infer what kind of people might be represented by that cluster. Use the principal component interpretations from step 2.3 or look at additional components to help you make this inference. Alternatively, you can use the `.inverse_transform()` method of the PCA and StandardScaler objects to transform centroids back to the original data space and interpret the retrieved values directly.\n",
    "- Perform a similar investigation for the underrepresented clusters. Which cluster or clusters are underrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population, and what kinds of people are typified by these clusters?"

    "\n",
    "After performing a K-Means clustering algorithm with 8 clusters, two segments were over-represented in the customer data, one segment was equally represented, and the remaining five segments were under-represented. The over-represented groups were both characterized by wealthy, older, and more conservative individuals (cluster indices 1 and 6). The one cluster that was equally represented consisted of moderately wealthy young females (cluster index 0). Finally, the remaining clusters contained people that were either not so wealthy or not so mature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in the analysis, an additional segment was identified that was excluded from the bulk of the analysis due to a high fraction of NaNs (cluster index -1, ~10% of the data). This segment is interesting, because it demonstrates some characteristics similar to the company's core customer base, specifically moderate to high wealth. However, one could hypothesize that this cluster is being overlooked by the company's current advertising scheme. While the group is filled with advertising enthusiasts, the group also embraces minimalism, nature, and shows aversion to cross-channel buying behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the mail order company seems to have success with individuals that are established both socially and financially. By adjusting their advertising strategy, they may be able to reach an additional ~10% of the population that appears to be an attractive consumer group."

Before you finish, make sure to check through the entire notebook from top to bottom to make sure that your analysis follows a logical flow and all of your findings are documented in **Discussion** cells. Once you've checked over all of your work, you should export the notebook as an HTML document to submit for evaluation. You can do this from the menu, navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. You will submit both that document and this notebook for your project submission."
